A project containing data visualizations about the sources of greenhouse gases.

Click [here](https://youtu.be/ZEByH3NA2Nw) to see the product demo.

### Purpose
Greenhouse gases have a big influence on the climate change and they consist of the well-known carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinatedgases (F-GAS). The two gases that are the biggest of greenhouse gases are CO2 and methane.
CO2 is a gas that mostly arises from the production of energy. Methane is, after CO2, an important gas that has a strong effect on the climate, mostly caused by agriculture. All these gases are measured in CO2 equivalents, to be able to compare to data. The visualizations on the website will show the total greenhouse gas emissions per country, divided by sector and gas type.

### Website features

#### Visualizations
The  visualizations will first show the greenhouse gas emissions in the world, divided by country, sector and gas type.
The **map** shows the greenhouse gas emissions per country with color gradients. By *hovering* over the map, you can see the name of the country and its exact data. By *clicking* on the map, the bar chart and radar chart will update with the data of the selected country.

The **bar chart** shows the greenhouse gas per type of gas (CO2, CH4, N2O and F-GAS), of the world or selected country. By *hovering* over the bar, you will see the exact data and its percentage of the total gases.

The **radar chart** shows the greenhouse gas per sector (Energy, Bunker fuels, Waste, Agriculture and Industry). By *hovering* over the radar, you will see the exact percentage for the selected sector.

#### Interactive components
With the **select bar** you can select the country you want to visualize in the linked bar and radar chart. With the **slider** you can select the year you want to see the data from.
