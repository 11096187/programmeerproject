# Report

### Short description
This project contains visualizations that will show the greenhouse gas emissions in the world, divided by country, sector and gas type. By *hovering* over the **map**, you can see the total emissions per country. By *clicking* on the **map**, the **bar chart** and **radar chart** will update the emissions per gas and per sector for the selected country. *Hover* over the charts to catch the exact data. With the **select bar** and **slider**, you can respectively change the country and year.

### Technical design
#### Overview
The project map consists of:
- A bootstrap map that contains scripts, css and images for the theme of the website.
- A code map consisting of css and js files needed for the visualizations.
- A data map containing all the data used.

#### Detail
In the code map you can find the all the js and css files needed for de visualizations.

**main.js** is a file that loads the data and functions to make the visualizations, the slider and the select bar. 

**barchart.js**, **map.js** and **radar.js** are the files that contain the functions to make and update the visualizations and their titles.

**components.js** contains the two functions (*makeSlider();* and *select();*) that make and call the slider and select bar used by the visualizations.
