# Report

## Short description
This project contains visualizations that will show the greenhouse gas emissions in the world, divided by country, sector and gas type. By *hovering* over the **map**, you can see the total emissions per country. By *clicking* on the **map**, the **bar chart** and **radar chart** will update the emissions per gas and per sector for the selected country. *Hover* over the charts to catch the exact data. With the **select bar** and **slider**, you can respectively change the country and year.

## Technical design
### Overview
The project map consists of:
- A bootstrap map that contains scripts, css and images for the theme of the website.
- A code map consisting of css and javascript files needed for the visualizations.
- A data map containing all the data used.

### Detail
####js
In the *js map* you can find the all the javascript files needed for de visualizations.
- **main.js** is a file that loads the data and functions to make the visualizations, the slider and the select bar. 
- **barchart.js**, **map.js** and **radar.js** are the files that contain the functions to make and update the visualizations and their titles.
- **components.js** contains the two functions that make the slider and select bar used by the visualizations.

####css
The *css map* contains the css files used to add style to all visualizations.
- **main.css** contains style code used by all visualizations and the website, like style for the *tooltip* or *fonts* .
- **radar.css** contains style code explicitly used by the radar chart.

## Challenges
During the project I realized that several plans I've made weren't really feasible in the short amount of time. Because of the fact that I've spent a lot of time searching for the data that would explain what I wanted to tell, some visualizations or functionalities that I had in mind were just too complex for the time being. In making decisions about what you want to implement, you have to choose whether spending a lot of time on one specific thing is worth it, since you have to think about meeting all requirements. 

I've changed the following things during the project:
