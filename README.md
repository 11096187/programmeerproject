### [Green or not?](https://11096187.github.io/programmeerproject/index.html)
#### A project by Felicia van Gastel (11096187)

A project containing data visualizations about the sources of greenhouse gases.

### Purpose
Greenhouse gases have a big influence on the climate change and they consist of the well-known carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinatedgases (F-GAS). The two gases that are the biggest of greenhouse gases are CO2 and methane.
CO2 is a gas that mostly arises from the production of energy. Methane is, after CO2, an important gas that has a strong effect on the climate, mostly caused by agriculture. All these gases are measured in CO2 equivalents, to be able to compare to data. The visualizations on the website will show the total greenhouse gas emissions per country, divided by sector and gas type.

### Website features
#### Introduction

#### About
After entering the intro page, you will get some information about the purpose and functions of the project.

#### The map
By hovering over the map, you can see the total emissions per country.
By clicking on the map, the barchart and radarchart will show you
in that order emissions per gas and per sector for the selected country.

#### The bar chart

#### The radar chart


- A **world map** with color gradients showing the amount of greenhouse gases per country. The map will contain **two buttons** with which you can choose to see the total CO2 emission of a country, the total of greenhouse gases or the CO2 emission per capita. With a **slider** you can change the year of the data. When you **click** on a country on a map, the corresponding data of the country will be shown in the multiline chart and the zoomable sunburst. Without clicking, data about the world as a whole will be shown.
- A **multiline chart** shows information about for example CO2 emissions and production of meat and crops over the years.
- A **sunburst** shows from on what contents the CO2 emission is based.
